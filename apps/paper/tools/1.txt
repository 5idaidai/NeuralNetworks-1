[" ", "Police stopped Carl Josephs on suspicion of having a stolen car.\n", "They stopped him on suspicion of having a criminal record.\n", "They stopped him on suspicion of carrying drugs, of not wearing a seat belt, of driving where he did not belong.\n", "They stopped him, he said, 34 times in two years, until finally he started taking the bus to work. \n", "Because he never was found to have done anything wrong _ never ended up with so much as a speeding ticket _ Josephs, a quality-control supervisor in a meat factory, could only conclude that he was singled out because he was black and drove a car with a big picture of Bob Marley, the late Jamaican reggae star, on the back.\n", "Every time I went out of the house, the first thing I thought is, `Am I going to be harassed?\n", "he said. \n", "Finally, he couldn't take it any more.\n", "In the first case of its kind in Britain, he sued the West Midlands Police, complaining that he had been racially harassed.\n", "And though he won on only one of his complaints _ that he had been wrongfully stopped on one occasion _ his case added to what has become an increasingly noisy debate in Britain about the way police treat people from minority groups. \n", "For years, black and Asian Britons have complained about what they see as overt and tacit police racism, and except at times of particular upheaval, like the riots in Brixton in 1981, no one in authority in Britain has paid much attention. \n", "But in the last few months, the issue has been at the forefront of the country's consciousness.\n", "More and more people like Josephs are making public complaints. \n", "Home Secretary Jack Straw recently told a parliamentary committee that he planned to require Britain's police departments to hire more minority officers.\n", "And the government is poised to release a stinging report about race and the police that is likely to order nothing less than a sea change in British police culture. \n", "The impetus for all this is the six-year-old case of Stephen Lawrence, a case that Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, described in an interview as  Rodney King without the video.\n", "Lawrence, an 18-year-old black student who was set upon and stabbed to death in South London in 1993 by a group of white youths who directed a racial epithet at him.\n", "What happened to him _ and how police apparently botched the inquiry _ has proved a galvanizing force among minority groups, as well as forcing the rest of the public to pay attention. \n", "The Stephen Lawrence case has got such exposure that in other places, like Birmingham, cases of racial terror and injustice are finally being recognized,'' said Maxie Hayles, chairman of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit.\n", "It's a shame that it should take the death of a schoolboy to bring this out in the open, but unfortunately that's what did it.\n", "Straw is due to release a much-anticipated independent report this month on police handling of the case.\n", "The report is expected to present a damning portrait of police incompetence and racial prejudice, and to conclude that the Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest police force, is guilty of pervasive institutional racism. \n", "Richard Norton-Taylor, whose play about Lawrence's killing,  The Color of Justice,'' has been playing to rave reviews in London, said that the attention paid to the Lawrence case and others was a sign that British attitudes toward the overarching authority of the police and other institutions were finally being called into question. \n", "There's been an antipathy building up toward the cops for all sorts of different reasons, but it hasn't been part of the culture to have movements, to protest in an organized way,'' he said.\n", "But what we're seeing now is that there's a slow building up of demands for more openness, whether on racism or consumerism or medical matters.\n", "There is much less deference.\n", "That there may be racism in the Metropolitan Police hardly seems surprising in a city where 20 percent of the population, but only 2.3 percent of the police force, is made up of people from minority groups.\n", "Of the 860 or so black and Asian police officers, only 24 hold the rank of inspector and above, and only about 20 are sergeants, said Inspector Leroy Logan, chairman of the National Black Police Association.\n", "(As a whole, ethnic minorities account for 5.6 percent of the British population, and 2 percent, or 2,500, of the 127,000 police officers in England and Wales). \n", "But it has taken Britain _ at least white Britain _ until now to ask whether there is anything unusual about these numbers. \n", "Britain has never had anything like the American civil rights movement.\n", "Nor has it had an affirmative action system or a system of racial quotas.\n", "Large numbers of black residents began arriving only about 50 years ago, coming by boat from the Caribbean as part of an influx of post-war immigration, giving parts of Britain a sizable minority population for the first time. \n", "Nor is there a history of slavery here.\n", "But black residents and members of other minority groups have had a hard time beating their way into the corridors of power.\n", "Efforts to change the status quo have been difficult: Britain has traditionally been a society of deference, in which institutions of authority, like police department and other government agencies, are meant to be respected, not questioned. \n", "In Britain, people have traditionally acquiesced, rather than insisting on standing up and being counted,'' Logan said.\n", "In America the response has always been much more militant, more in your face.\n", "Here, until recently, racism was not a word that was generally discussed in the media, and it was not something on every chief constable's agenda.\n", "Suddenly, the community has been galvanized.\n", "Recent polls show that confidence in the police is falling.\n", "In a poll conducted by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph, 60 percent of people interviewed said that they were satisfied with the way the police do their job, compared with 74 percent 10 years ago.\n", "At the same time, a third of those questioned said they believed the police treated black and Asian people worse than they treated whites. \n", "Why has the Lawrence case been so important?\n", "If it hadn't been for the determination of Stephen Lawrence's parents, his death would probably have been quickly forgotten and filed away.\n", "But Neville and Doreen Lawrence pushed for answers from what they said was a high-handed police department.\n", "When none of the five young white men who were identified by numerous informants as the likely murderers were brought to trial, Stephen's family brought a civil suit against them. \n", "In the end, there was insufficient evidence to find anyone guilty of Stephen's murder.\n", "But the civil case _ and an inquest in which all five suspects smirkingly refused to answer questions on the advice of their lawyers _ provoked widespread outrage, even from such unlikely quarters as the right-leaning Daily Mail newspaper, which daringly printed the suspects' names and embarked on a campaign on behalf of the Lawrences.\n", "In addition to Norton-Taylor's play, the case has been the subject of numerous television programs, including documentaries and a searing docudrama examining the case from the Lawrences' point of view. \n", "At the same time, the government not only ordered an inquiry into the case, but also began examining the culture of the country's police forces.\n", "Now, Straw is considering changes to a system that has protected police officers guilty of misconduct and allowed them to retire early with their pensions intact.\n", "Such officers, under legislation he is looking at, would have their pensions cut by up to 75 percent. \n", "Civil rights leaders say that they are impressed by the Labor government's efforts.\n", "There is quite a sea change with the Blair administration,'' said Herbert of the Society of Black Lawyers.\n", "It empathizes and understands that if you have an injustice against part of society, than sooner or later it affects everybody.\n"]
